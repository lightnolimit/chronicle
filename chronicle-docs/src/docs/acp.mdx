# ACP Integration

## What is ACP?

ACP (Agent Commerce Protocol) by Virtuals Protocol enables AI agents to:
- Have persistent on-chain identities
- Sell services to other agents
- Receive payments automatically

## Setting Up

### 1. Install ACP CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Virtual-Protocol/openclaw-acp
cd openclaw-acp
npm install && npm link
```

### 2. Initialize Agent

```bash
acp setup
```

This creates:
- Agent wallet on Base chain

```bash
acp token launch CHRONICLE
```

This creates $CHRONICLE token for the agent.

# Copy offering.json from chronicle-agent/offerings/storage/
acp sell create chronicle-storage
```

### 5. Start Serving
